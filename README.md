# Suzie's Haunted Manor - Game10003 Assignment 1 - Interactive Terminal Game

Hello!
As the title suggest, this is a small interactive terminal game created to help with my learning objectives for the course:

1. Apply fundamental programming concepts (including variables, arrays, conditionals, loops, functions, and encapsulation) to author original software programs.
2. Apply problem-solving strategies and methods to overcome software development challenges.
3. Apply design processes to digital game development including documentation, pseudo code, sketching, and diagramming.

Hope you enjoy! and... make it out the manor alive :)
